This is an app that takes in an user's food (maybe 3-5 items to start with) from their fridge and brings up recipes and creates a menu potentially for the week. Also, we want to select recipes and print a shopping list based on that. This is geared towards college students and those who donâ€™t have too much food on hand, or go food shopping.
