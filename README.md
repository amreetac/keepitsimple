Keep It Simple!

This is an app that takes in an user's food (maybe 3-5 items to start with) from their fridge and brings up recipes. Also, we want to select recipes from ingredients that users
in general would like to select. This is geared towards anyone who doesn't have too much food on hand and help them make recipes!
